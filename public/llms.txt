# PDFusion

> PDFusion is a web application designed to merge PDF templates with user-provided data (CSV or JSON). It features a visual editor for placing data fields onto the PDF template and supports batch generation of customized PDF documents.

PDFusion allows users to:
- Upload a base PDF template.
- Import data from CSV or JSON files.
- Visually drag and drop data fields (column headers) onto the PDF preview.
- Customize the appearance of placed labels (font, size, style).
- Export a single PDF based on the current data record or batch export PDFs for all data records.
- Configure customizable file naming patterns using data variables.
- Integrate with local email clients using customizable email templates (To, Subject, Body) with data variables.

The application is built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, utilizing libraries like pdf-lib for PDF manipulation and pdf.js for rendering. Layouts and settings are persisted using browser localStorage.
